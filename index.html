        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
          Libcorrect is a BSD-licensed library for forward error correction. What this means is that it can be given a payload of data and apply redundancy to the payload. The payload and redundancy are transmitted together and then sent along a medium that might add errors. Once received, the entire structure is decoded into the original payload. The redundancy allows libcorrect to decode the payload as long as the added errors do not exceed some limit....

        <p>
          I’ve been working on building documentation for Quiet Modem Project and I recently came up against a snag in documenting my iOS library that contains Objective-C. Although it’s mostly advisable to stick to writing iOS libraries in Swift these days, I chose Objective-C because it felt nicer when wrapping C libraries. Since the core part of my project is a C library, being able to wrap it cleanly makes life a little easier for me....

        <p>
          Quiet.js and libquiet are capable of transmission via audible tones, ultrasonic tones, and through an audio cable at wide spectrum. Quiet provides a JSON file which provides parameters for each of these modes. A single set of parameters, a profile, sets the center frequency of the modem, the modulation, error correction modes used, and more. Creating a new profile in a way that’s robust to hardware limitations and yet provides good throughput can be difficult,...

          When I started working on libquiet, I was trying to answer a question for myself. I had seen projects which passed data through the headphone jack, which I thought was an interesting idea. I wanted to know how fast this method could send data. Many of these methods used Frequency-Shift Keying, which is easy to implement but typically does not achieve the maximum speed possible. I started researching, which lead me to liquid sdr which...
